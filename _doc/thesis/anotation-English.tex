Data analysis of user behaviour in accessing web sources has become a popular topic, due to its potential in improvement of services offered to the visitors of web. Most recent approaches examine possibilities of applying methods of machine learning.
Among these approaches, deep belief networks and reccurent neural networks are gaining popularity. They work with principles of unsupervised learning to identify important patterns in given data. In this paper, I focus on using reccurent neural networks with long short-term memory(LSTM) to analyze data from paywall of online news portals. Such analysis provides insight into the user behaviour and resulting feedback possibilities to the users of online news portals.
