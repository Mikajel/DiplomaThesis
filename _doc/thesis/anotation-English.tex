Data analysis of user behaviour in accessing web sources has become a popular topic, due to its potential in improvement of services offered to the visitors of web. Most recent approaches examine possibilities of applying methods of machine learning.
 In this paper, I focus on using reccurent neural networks with long short-term memory(LSTM) to analyze data from paywall of online news portals. Such analysis provides insight into the user behaviour and resulting feedback possibilities to the users of online news portals. Management of service-oriented business is starting to realize the value of loyal customer on the market. It is necessary to detect customer evaluating churning and use positive motivation to keep his loyalty.
